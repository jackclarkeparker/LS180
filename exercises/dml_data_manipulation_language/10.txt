Delete Accelerometer

Our workshop has decided to not make an Accelerometer after all. Delete any data related to 
"Accelerometer", this includes the parts associated with an Accelerometer.

DELETE FROM parts WHERE device_id = 1;
DELETE FROM devices WHERE name = 'Accelerometer';



Further Exploration

This process may have been a bit simpler if we had initially defined our devices tables a bit 
differently. We could delete both a device and its associated parts with one SQL statement if that 
were the case. What change would have to be made to table parts to make this possible?
Also, what SQL statement would you have to write that can delete both a device and its parts all in 
one go?

We would have needed to define our device_id foreign key with a DELETE ON clause, that specified
the CASCADE option. This clause gives PostgreSQL instructions on what to do when referenced rows
are deleted - delete the rows of parts tht reference the row to be deleted.

The statement that we then could have written to delete both device and its parts would have been
the statement above that deletes the device:

DELETE FROM devices WHERE name = 'Accelerometer';
