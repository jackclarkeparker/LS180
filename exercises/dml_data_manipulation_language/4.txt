SELECT part_number

We want to grab all parts that have a part_number that starts with 3. Write a SELECT query to get this information. This table may show all attributes of the parts table.



SELECT * FROM parts
  WHERE substring(part_number::varchar from 1 for 1) = '3';


I used the `substring()` function, but LS used the LIKE operator for string matching.
