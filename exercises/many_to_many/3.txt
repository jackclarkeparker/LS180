Get Customers With No Services

Write a query to retrieve the customer data for every customer who does not currently subscribe to 
any services.



SELECT customers.* FROM customers
  LEFT OUTER JOIN customers_services ON customers_services.customer_id = customers.id
  WHERE customers_services.service_id IS NULL;

Further Exploration

Can you write a query that displays all customers with no services and all services that currently 
don't have any customers? The output should look like this:

SELECT customers.*, services.*
  FROM customers
  LEFT OUTER JOIN customers_services ON customers_services.customer_id = customers.id
  FULL OUTER JOIN services ON customers_services.service_id = services.id
  WHERE customers_services.id IS NULL;

(The first OUTER JOIN can be a FULL OUTER JOIN too)
