Hypothetically



SELECT sum(price)
  FROM services
  INNER JOIN customers_services ON service_id = services.id
  WHERE price > 100;

SELECT sum(price)
  FROM services
  CROSS JOIN customers
  WHERE price > 100;



Further Exploration
This exercise is really contrived: it just shows how hard it is to come up with a possible use case for CROSS JOIN. CROSS JOIN is generally best suited to generating test data rather than production queries.

Can you think of any other situations where a CROSS JOIN might be useful?


Say you have two teams of rugby players, each stored in their own table.
You can use a CROSS JOIN to establish all of the matchups between individual players of
the two teams, so to store data on how they perform in interactions on the field
for a given match. This might help you collect data to help assess the strengths and
weaknesses of different players.
