Get Services With No Customers

Using RIGHT OUTER JOIN, write a query to display a list of all services that are not currently in 
use. Your output should look like this:


SELECT services.description FROM customers_services
  RIGHT OUTER JOIN services ON customers_services.service_id = services.id
  WHERE customers_services.customer_id IS NULL;
