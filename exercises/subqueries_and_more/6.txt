Scalar Subqueries


SELECT name, (SELECT count(bids.item_id) FROM bids where items.id = bids.item_id)
  FROM items;



Further Exploration
If we wanted to get an equivalent result, without using a subquery, then we would have to use a LEFT 
OUTER JOIN. Can you come up with the equivalent query that uses a JOIN clause?



SELECT name, count(item_id) FROM items
  LEFT OUTER JOIN bids
    ON bids.item_id = items.id
  GROUP BY name;


Reading other solutions, I see that to get the same ordering, we've also got to provide an
ORDER BY items.id clause, which necessitates that the GROUP BY clause groups by the items.id
as well.
