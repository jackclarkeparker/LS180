Conditional Subqueries: EXISTS



SELECT bidders.name FROM bidders
  WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT bidder_id FROM bids
    WHERE bidder_id = bidders.id
  );


LS solution pointed out that what is returned by the subquery select doesn't
matter, so long as it returns rows when it needs to, and doesn't return rows
when it shouldn't - They did `SELECT 1 FROM bids...`



Further Exploration

More often than not, we can get an equivalent result by using a JOIN clause, instead of a subquery. 
Can you figure out a SELECT query that uses a JOIN clause that returns the same output as our 
solution above?



SELECT DISTINCT bidders.name FROM bidders
  INNER JOIN bids ON bids.bidder_id = bidders.id;
