Write a SQL query that finds all films whose director has the first name John.


SELECT * FROM films WHERE director LIKE 'John%';

My solution here would also select films from people whose first name began with John, like Johnson, or Johnny.

LS solution was the same as mine, but with whitespace specified after the name:
"John %"
