1. What does the file do?
2. What is the output of the command? What does each line in this output mean?
3. Open up the file and look at its contents. What does the first line do?


1. -> The file creates a table called `films`, and populates it with three records.
2. -> It first attempts to drop a table, then creates it again, then inserts three records.
3. -> The first line deletes a table called `films` if it already exists.
      (I guess the `public` prefix has something to do with `films` being a publically
       available table)
