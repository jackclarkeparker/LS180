What error is shown if the constraint created in #7 is violated? Write a SQL INSERT statement that demonstrates this.


INSERT INTO films (title, year, genre, director, duration)
VALUES ('', 2001, 'Epic Fantasy', 'Peter Jackson', 168);

ERROR: title doesn't pass CHECK constraint (title_not_empty)
DETAIL: ('', 2001, 'Epic Fantasy', 'Peter Jackson', 168)

Something along these lines? ^^^




Actually was this:

ERROR:  new row for relation "films" violates check constraint "title_not_empty"
DETAIL:  Failing row contains (, 2001, Epic Fantasy, Peter Jackson, 168).
