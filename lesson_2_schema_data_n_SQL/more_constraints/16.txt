List three ways to use the schema to restrict what values can be stored in a column.

1. Data-type of the column
2. Constraints placed on the column (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK)
3. Where the column is a FOREIGN KEY (can't input values for this column that don't exist in the 
                                      PRIMARY KEY column of the associated table)
