Describe the difference between the integer, decimal, and real data types.


All are Numerical data types.

- integer is whole numbers

- decimal is for arbitary precision numbers, which is to say, they are non-floating-point fractional numbers. 
  Decimal takes two type modifiers, one that specifies the precision of the number (how many
  digits it must be made up of) and the other which specifies the scale of the number (how many 
  digits can appear to the right of the decimal point).


- real is for floating point numbers. These are faster than arbitrary precision numbers, but less accurate.
