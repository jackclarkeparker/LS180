Describe the difference between the varchar and text data types.

Both varchar and text are string data types.
varchar requires a type modifier to specify the maximum length of string entries it will take
text does not require this.
text however, is a datatype that is exclusive to PostgreSQL, and won't work over other RDBMS.
