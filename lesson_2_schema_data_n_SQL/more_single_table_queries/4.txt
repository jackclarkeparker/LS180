SELECT trim(substring(email from '@.*$'), '@') AS domain,
       count(substring(email from '@.*$'))
          FROM people
          GROUP BY domain
          ORDER BY count DESC;


THEY used the other variety of substring, which takes an index from which to select from:
    substr(string [from int], [for int])
(this variety has the alias `substr` available to it)

They then used the `strpos()` function to find the index in `email` where '@' occurred,
and added 1 to this so as to exclude it.

ALSO the count function doesn't need to count those domains, it can just count something like `id`, which will always be present anyway...

Otherwise fairly similar.
