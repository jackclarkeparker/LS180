What is a physical schema?

A physical schema is a low-level database-specific implementation of a conceptual schema.
It won't describe abstract entities, but instead outline the relations that are the manifestation of those entities.
Included in a physical schema will be the names of all tables and their attributes, as well as the datatypes of attributes, and the rules for how they will relate to one another.
Often we'll specify the constraints applied to various attributes here as well.
