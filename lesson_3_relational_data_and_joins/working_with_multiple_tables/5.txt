Write a query that returns the name of each event and how many tickets were sold for it, in order from most popular to least popular.



SELECT events.name, COUNT(tickets.id) AS popularity
  FROM events
  INNER JOIN tickets
    ON events.id = tickets.event_id
  GROUP BY events.name
  ORDER BY popularity DESC;



LS solution used LEFT OUTER JOIN instead of INNER JOIN.
  -> The logic here is that an event that doesn't have any tickets sold yet will still be included in
     the query. Makes good sense.

  - Ask yourself. What would I be excluding with an INNER JOIN here. What would I include by using
    each form of OUTER JOIN?
