Write a query to print out a report of all tickets purchased by the customer with the email address 'gennaro.rath@mcdermott.co'. The report should include the event name and starts_at and the seat's section name, row, and seat number.

SELECT events.name AS event, events.starts_at, sections.name, seats.row, seats.number AS seat
  FROM customers
  INNER JOIN tickets
    ON customers.id = tickets.customer_id
  INNER JOIN events
    ON events.id = tickets.event_id
  INNER JOIN seats
    ON seats.id = tickets.seat_id
  INNER JOIN sections
    ON sections.id = seats.section_id
  WHERE customers.email = 'gennaro.rath@mcdermott.co';



Woops, I didn't catch section.name -> needed a column alias
