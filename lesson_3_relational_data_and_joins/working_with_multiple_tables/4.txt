Write a query that determines what percentage of the customers in the database have purchased a ticket to one or more of the events.

SELECT round(count(DISTINCT t.customer_id) * 100.0 / count(DISTINCT c.id), 2) AS percent
    FROM customers AS c
    FULL JOIN tickets AS t
    ON c.id = t.customer_id;                                                                


Okay, this was hacked together.
- I didn't consider which kind of JOIN was necessary.
- I didn't tidy it up too much
  - That's because I was anticipating that LS would provide a totally different solution.
    But they basically used my solution!

THINGS LS DID DIFFERNETLY:
- They cast to a decimal using `::decimal` notation. (TOGGLE THIS)
- They performed both count operations first, and then did the multiplcation by 100 afterwards.
- They used only a LEFT OUTER JOIN.
