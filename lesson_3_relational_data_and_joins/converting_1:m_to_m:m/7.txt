Write a SQL statement that determines how many films each director in the database has directed. 
Sort the results by number of films (greatest first) and then name (in alphabetical order).



SELECT directors.name AS director, COUNT(films.id) AS films_directed
  FROM directors
  LEFT OUTER JOIN directors_films ON directors_films.director_id = directors.id
  INNER JOIN films ON directors_films.film_id = films.id
  GROUP BY directors.name
  ORDER BY films_directed DESC, directors.name;

OKAY so the LS solution didn't join the films table, but counted the number of films directly from
directors_films which is probably faster. Not an issue really :)
