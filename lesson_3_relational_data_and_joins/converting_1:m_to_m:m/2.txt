Write the SQL statement needed to create a join table that will allow a film to have multiple directors, and directors to have multiple films. Include an id column in this table, and add foreign key constraints to the other columns.



CREATE TABLE films_directors (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  film_id integer NOT NULL REFERENCES films(id),
  director_id integer NOT NULL REFERENCES directors(id)
);



LS uses directors_films
-> Table names with more than one word are written in alphabetical order in SQL
-> They didn't specify NOT NULL Foreign Key Columns, but I still will.

CREATE TABLE directors_films (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  director_id integer NOT NULL REFERENCES directors(id),
  film_id integer NOT NULL REFERENCES films(id)
);
