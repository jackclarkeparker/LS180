Write the SQL statements needed to insert data into the new join table to represent the existing one-to-many relationships.



INSERT INTO directors_films(director_id, film_id)
VALUES (1, 1),
       (2, 2),
       (3, 3), (3, 7),
       (4, 4), (4, 10),
       (5, 5),
       (6, 6),
       (7, 8),
       (8, 9);



After reading up about using SELECT instead of values, did the same like this:

INSERT INTO directors_films (director_id, film_id)
  SELECT directors.id, films.id
  FROM directors
  INNER JOIN films ON films.director_id = directors.id;
