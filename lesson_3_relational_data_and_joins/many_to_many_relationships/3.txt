Write SQL statements to insert the following new books into the database. What do you need to do to ensure this data fits in the database?



To insert this data into the database, we've first got to insert the Primary Keys of each of the 
"many" tables before creating their associations - The foreign keys of associations in the join table
must reference existing rows in each of the many tables. 

Also need to adjust the schema, allowing for varchar inputs of greater length for title column - 
adjusting to 50 chars now.



ALTER TABLE books ALTER COLUMN title TYPE varchar(50);

INSERT INTO books(title, author)
  VALUES ('Sally Ride: America''s First Woman in Space', 'Lynn Sherr'),
         ('Jane Eyre', 'Charlotte BrontÃ«'),
         ('Vij''s: Elegant and Inspired Indian Cuisine', 'Meeru Dhalwala and Vikram Vij');

INSERT INTO categories (name)
  VALUES ('Space Exploration'), ('Cookbook'), ('South Asia');

INSERT INTO books_categories(book_id, category_id)
  VALUES (4, 5), (4, 1), (4, 7),
         (5, 2), (5, 4),
         (6, 8), (6, 1), (6, 9);
