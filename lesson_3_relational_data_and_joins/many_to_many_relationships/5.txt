Write a SQL statement that will return the following result:




SELECT categories.name AS genre,
       count(categories.id) AS book_count,
       STRING_AGG(books.title, ', ') AS book_titles
  FROM categories
  LEFT OUTER JOIN books_categories ON books_categories.category_id = categories.id
  INNER JOIN books ON books_categories.book_id = books.id
  GROUP BY genre ORDER BY genre;


Launch School COUNTed by books.id instead of categories.id, which has the same outcome, but is much 
more intuitive.
