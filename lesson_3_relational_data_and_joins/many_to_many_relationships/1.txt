The books_categories table from this database was created with foreign keys that don't have the NOT NULL and ON DELETE CASCADE constraints. Go ahead and add them now.



ALTER TABLE books_categories
  DROP CONSTRAINT books_categories_book_id_fkey,
  DROP CONSTRAINT books_categories_category_id_fkey,
  ALTER COLUMN book_id SET NOT NULL,
  ALTER COLUMN category_id SET NOT NULL,
  ADD FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id),
  ADD FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES categories(id);


GAHHHHH I always forget the ON DELETE CASCADE clause!

ALTER TABLE books_categories
  DROP CONSTRAINT books_categories_book_id_fkey,
  DROP CONSTRAINT books_categories_category_id_fkey,
  ALTER COLUMN book_id SET NOT NULL,
  ALTER COLUMN category_id SET NOT NULL,
  ADD FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  ADD FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES categories(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
