Write a SQL statement that will prevent NULL values from being stored in orders.product_id. What happens if you execute that statement?



ALTER TABLE orders ALTER COLUMN product_id SET NOT NULL;

If we try to execute this statement above ^^, an error will be raised.
In the previous problem we inserted a row into orders that contained a NULL value
for the product_id column, which would violate a NOT NULL constraint were it in place.
We can't place a constraint on a column that contains values that violate that constraint.
We must first remove these rows, or update their values such that they won't violate the constraint.
We can then put the NOT NULL constraint in place afterwards.
