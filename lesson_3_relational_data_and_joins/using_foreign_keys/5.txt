Can you insert a row into orders without a product_id? Write a SQL statement to prove your answer.




No, I cannot. This is because the FOREIGN KEY Constraint requires that values inserted in it's column
already exist in the Primary Key column of the referenced table.

That we cannot insert values that don't already exist in the referenced primary key column is what preserves the referential integrity of the data in a database.

I'll use this statement to prove it:
INSERT INTO orders (product_id, quantity)
  VALUES (3, 100);


WOAH.
I didn't read the question properly! I thought it read "Can I insert a row into orders with a 
product_id that doesn't exist in products".

I really gotta read questions 20% slower.



Trying again now.

I guess FOREIGN KEYS don't have the NOT NULL constraints of PRIMARY KEYS.
We'll often choose to set them to be NOT NULL, from the perspective of ensuring that all
rows present in the table will associate with some data in the referenced table.
However, this is an optional inclusion.
