Write a SQL statement that returns a result like this:



SELECT orders.quantity, products.name
  FROM orders
  INNER JOIN products
    ON orders.product_id = products.id;


LS didn't prefix their column names with table names - a small data set, unique column names anyway.
Sure, table names weren't necessary here.
