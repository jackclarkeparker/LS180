True or false: A foreign key constraint prevents NULL values from being stored in a column.



false

We'll often choose to give a foreign key column a NOT NULL constraint such that all rows
entered in the table will associate with a row in the referenced table. However, this is
not enforced by way of the foreign key constraint alone, like is the case with Primary Keys.
