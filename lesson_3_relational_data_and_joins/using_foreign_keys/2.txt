Update the orders table so that referential integrity will be preserved for the data between orders and products.


ALTER TABLE orders ADD FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id);

I couldn't figure out for the longest time why my code wasn't working.
I was writing the final clause like so: REFERENCES products.id;
